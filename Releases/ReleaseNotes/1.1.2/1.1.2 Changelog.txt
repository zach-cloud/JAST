A major code split has been performed; the JASS syntax parser was split off
from the JAST code, and the String Hash utility also has been split. These
projects are available through Maven Central for any programmer to use.

This enables me to work on other tools that involve parsing of a .j file,
including a war3map.doo restoration tool.

The design of the syntax parser was changed from immutable to mutable.
This means that the program does not need to "copy" the syntax tree
every time it performs an operation like renaming variables.
This should increase performance of operations significantly, and make
the program consume less memory.

I'm going to work on refactoring the GUI piece of this project into
modules to make it better, and then code new functionality. The next
piece I want to code is function analysis tools. Specifically the first
one I want to do is a tool to extract all usages of a variable or function.

0.1.2 release notes:
- Supports exporting MPQ files. Command: "export <myMap.w3x> <outputDirectory>".
- This command exports war3map.j, war3map.wts, war3map.w3u, war3map.w3a, and war3map.w3t files if they exist in the archive.
- Support for external cheatpacks added. To leverage this, put your cheatpacks in a folder called "cheatpacks" at the root of the program.
- If not provided as external cheatpacks, the system will use JJCP or NZCP as internal cheatpacks. However external ones are prioritized.
- MPQ inserting is not yet supported. The software used to modify MPQs (JMPQ3) is sort of broken. I will be looking into this in the future but it's low priortity since there are so many MPQ editors out there.


I will now begin the long and annoying process of making this a graphical application rather than a command-line application.
I'm aware that people don't like command line applications and therefore won't even try this program because of it.
I just wanted to get a release out fast with usable functionality. Efforts will now be placed on making it more user-friendly.
Any new feature requests or bugs reported will also be added ASAP.
